# Sleep in mammals
Why different mammals have different sleep? What are the factors impact it?
# Introduction
Different animals have different sleep, and it can be divided into two parts: slow-wave sleep (non-dreaming) and paradoxical sleep (dreaming)*. The duration of those two periods are also different in each species. Why does it happened? And how ecological and constitutional factors impact on the period? This project analyzed the inner and outer factors that might impact the sleep of different mammals.

# Background
Theres is a dataset from the article "Sleep in Mammals: Ecological and Constitutional Correlated" by Allison, which contains 11 variables and 61 observations. In this article, Allison assessed statiscally interrelationships between sleep, ecological and constitutional variables for 39 mammalian species. The results indicate that the slow-wave sleep is negatively associated with body size, and the paradoxical sleep is impacted by predatory danger.
In the dataset, ecological variables are predation index, sleep exposure index and overall danger index. All the indexes are counted from one to five, one equals minimum and five equals maximum. The constitutional variables are mammals' bodyweight in Kilogram, brain weight in gram, maximum lifespan in years and gestation time in days. Sleep are divided into slow-wave sleep, paradoxical sleep and total sleep which are counted by hours per day.

# Summary 
There are no factors directly correlated with mammals' sleep in this dataset, but the ecological and constitutional factors do have some hard-defined relations or do have some impacts on mammalsâ€™ overall sleep time.
